    <h1>Algorithm Description</h1>
    
    1. Data was crawled and scraped from the afltables, and validated by footywire data; data were then stored by game
    <br><br>
    2. Additional features were generated
    <br><br>
    3. Features were normalised (x-mean)/sd within each game - with normalisation performed both with respect to only their team and the players on both teams.
    <br><br>
    4. Brownlow votes were turned into three labels using one hot encoding (i.e. 1 vote model: player with 1 vote has label 1, every other player 0; 2 vote model: player with 2 votes has label 2, every other player 0 etc); thus three final models were required
    <br><br>
    5. For each model, features that had abs(correlation with label) higher than 0.1 were selected
    <br><br>
    6. Many regression models were attempted (tuned to best validation score hyperparameter combination)
    <br><br>

    -  <em>models attempted includes: Linear Regression (with regularisation), Binomial Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, GradientBoost Regressor, XGB Regressor, LightGBM Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, Explainable Boosting Machine Regressor, Fully Connected Neural Network Regressor</em>
    <br><br>

    Prediction
    <br><br>
    7. Each game was put through the three models to get predicted outputs. 
    <ul>
    
        <li>the player with highest predicted score for 3-votes model gets 3 predicted votes</li>
        
        <li>the player with highest predicted score for 2-votes model gets 2 predicted votes, unless they have already received 3 votes in which case the second ranked player for this model gets 2 votes</li>
        
        <li>the player with highest predicted score for 1-votes model gets 1 predicted votes, unless they have already received 3 votes or 2 votes in which case the second ranked player for this model gets 1 vote. If the second ranked player also has received a higher vote then the third ranked player receives 1 vote</li>

    </ul>
    8. Each game's votes are tallied up and the player with the highest vote for the season is the predicted Brownlow Winner
