    <h1>Algorithm Description</h1>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Data was crawled and scraped from AFL Tables and validated using Footywire data; the data was then stored by game.</li>
        <li>Additional features were generated.</li>
        <li><strong>Train-Val-Test Split:</strong> 70% of games from 2015-2022 were used as training data, with 15% used for validation and testing, respectively.</li>
        <li>Features were normalized <code>(x - mean) / sd</code> within each game. This normalization ensures comparability between games and mitigates issues such as reduced game time during the COVID-impacted 2020 season.</li>
        <li><strong>Targets:</strong> Targets were generated using min-max normalization of SuperCoach scores (scaled between 0-1), adjusted so that the Brownlow vote-getters in the game had the three highest scores, respectively.</li>
        <li>Various regression models were tested, each tuned to optimize the validation score based on the best hyperparameter combinations.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Models tested include: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, XGB Regressor, LightGBM Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, HistGradientBoost Regressor, Explainable Boosting Machine Regressor, SVM Regressor, NuSVM Regressor, Multilayer Perceptron Regressor, Transformer Regressor</em></li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Prediction</h2>
    
    <ol start="7">
        <li>Each game was processed through the model to generate predicted outputs:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The three players with the highest predicted scores received 3, 2, and 1 predicted votes, respectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The predicted votes for each game were tallied, and the player with the highest predicted votes for the season was declared the predicted Brownlow winner.</li>
    </ol>
